LED pattern refers to the specific arrangement or sequence of illuminated or blinking light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in a particular display or device. These patterns are often used for various applications, such as visual signaling, decorative lighting, or user feedback. LED patterns can vary in complexity and design, ranging from simple on/off patterns to more intricate sequences involving multiple colors and intensity levels. They provide a visually appealing and highly customizable means of conveying information or enhancing the aesthetics of electronic devices and systems.
